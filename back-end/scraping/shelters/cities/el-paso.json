        "description": "Annunciation House is a volunteer organization that offers hospitality to migrants, immigrants and refugees in the border region of El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez. It provides shelter, clothing, food, and other necessities to a lot of vulnerable individuals, mostly from Mexico and Central America.Annunciation House is the entry point for most of the guests. It hosts individuals that have short to mid term needs, who might stay for weeks or months. These individuals might be people who came to the U.S. seeking work, people that have fled their home country due to violence, corruption or extortion, or undocumented individuals/families that are living in El Paso but are currently facing financial hardship.Annunciation House includes four houses, each of which has a different focus, although these distinctions are fluid and change accordingly with the guest needs.Casa Vides:Is a long term house of hospitality for individuals that are going through immigration proceedings such as political asylum or other types of cases, and medical situations. It also provides hospitality to Mexican nationals, widows of U.S. citizens who must spend some time in the U.S to collect the Social Security benefits that they are entitled to receive.Casa del Refugiado:Is a very short-term house of hospitality to individuals that have just been released from ICE custody. It is the largest facility, with a capacity of around 500 people. Guests typically stay at this house somewhere between 1 to 3 days, which is usually enough time to address their basic needs while they connect with family/friends in the U.S. There is a high turnover in this house and numbers are very unpredictable as they depend on ICE's release weekly schedule. Casa Oscar Romero:It houses short-term and long-term guests making it the most varied house.Casa Teresa:Houses all the offices of the Annunciation House. Also, it has an apartment that volunteers can utilize as a gathering place for recreational/community time or use as a retreat on their days off.Mailing Address:Annunciation House, Inc.P.O. Box 11189El Paso, TX 79995-1189",

This is our newest facility, created in response to the growing number of homeless women in our community. Before this facility was created, homeless women were housed in a separate area within the mens emergency shelter. It grew evident that this arrangement was problematic, and that the women could best be protected and supported in pursuing their goals given a separate facility. Now that the women have a safe place of their own, they have truly developed a supportive, community environment. The residents work together to maintain the shelter, advocate for each other, connect each other to resources, and encourage each other to make positive changes in their lives. All residents receive three meals a day, clothing, and basic hygiene items. They are also connected with supportive case management services and have access to all the services the Opportunity Center has to offer.",

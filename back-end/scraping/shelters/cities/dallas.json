You can help others by donating now The Mens Home is a place where VICTORY is practiced. The Home offers individuals an opportunity to establish a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. Our philosophy is that drug and alcohol addictions are spiritual problems. Chemical addiction is chronic and progressive. If intervention is not easily available, the individual yields to its deadly impact. The Home is not interested in just curing the addiction of substance abuse; We believe the addict is not fully cured until he has the power to be all of his life controlling habits. ONLY God can grant that kind of cure.

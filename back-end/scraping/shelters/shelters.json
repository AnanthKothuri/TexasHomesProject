Our philosophy is that drug and alcohol addictions are spiritual problems. Chemical addiction is chronic and progressive. If intervention is not easily available, the individual yields to its deadly impact. The Home is not interested in just curing the addiction of substance abuse; We believe the addict is not fully cured until he has the power to be all of his life controlling habits.

      "description": "Housing Solutions &amp; Development Cornerstone has been helping men, women, and families find stability in their lives by meeting their housing needs since 1994. Eliminating housing barriers allows all people the opportunity to move forward and become more stable and productive members of our community. Our housing efforts focus on the individual who may be facing challenges with housing solutions. Our goal is to move individuals from insecurity in housing to a variety of permanent solutions including home ownership. Our goal is not to transition those in need into a living space, but to work with them toward their long term goals for life and housing desires. Over 25 properties have been made available since 2014 for affordable ownership. Many of them are now owned by individuals and families who once saw homeownership as an unreachable dream. Our current housing division includes three distinct avenues to sustained living. For men, the New Life Center in the up-and-coming Fairmount Historic District offers housing for men who have faced homelessness. Women who are being released from incarceration can become part of the Promise House, a place that provides safe shelter while working toward building a new life based upon Christian principles. We work to provide affordable homes to individuals and families who are ready and willing to achieve this goal. New Life Center New Life Center is a home where men who have faced homelessness can focus on education and meeting their long-term career goals. During their residence, each man is provided supportive services such as case management, mentoring, and spiritual, physical, emotional, and financial guidance. Despite where these men may come from, their future possibilities are limitless. Residents graduate from college every year, including one resident who graduated as Valedictorian from TCU. Those interested in being a resident may complete the application and interview process in person, Monday mornings at 9:30 am. No appointment is necessary. Applicants must be currently homeless and drug- and alcohol-free. 1628 Sixth Ave. Fort Worth, Texas 76104",

      "description": "Annunciation House is a volunteer organization that offers hospitality to migrants, immigrants and refugees in the border region of El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez. It provides shelter, clothing, food, and other necessities to a lot of vulnerable individuals, mostly from Mexico and Central America.Annunciation House is the entry point for most of the guests. It hosts individuals that have short to mid term needs, who might stay for weeks or months. These individuals might be people who came to the U.S. seeking work, people that have fled their home country due to violence, corruption or extortion, or undocumented individuals/families that are living in El Paso but are currently facing financial hardship.Annunciation House includes four houses, each of which has a different focus, although these distinctions are fluid and change accordingly with the guest needs.Casa Vides:Is a long term house of hospitality for individuals that are going through immigration proceedings such as political asylum or other types of cases, and medical situations. It also provides hospitality to Mexican nationals, widows of U.S. citizens who must spend some time in the U.S to collect the Social Security benefits that they are entitled to receive.Casa del Refugiado:Is a very short-term house of hospitality to individuals that have just been released from ICE custody. It is the largest facility, with a capacity of around 500 people. Guests typically stay at this house somewhere between 1 to 3 days, which is usually enough time to address their basic needs while they connect with family/friends in the U.S. There is a high turnover in this house and numbers are very unpredictable as they depend on ICE's release weekly schedule. Casa Oscar Romero:It houses short-term and long-term guests making it the most varied house.Casa Teresa:Houses all the offices of the Annunciation House. Also, it has an apartment that volunteers can utilize as a gathering place for recreational/community time or use as a retreat on their days off.Mailing Address:Annunciation House, Inc.P.O. Box 11189El Paso, TX 79995-1189",

      "description": "The Womens Resource Center (WRC) is an emergency shelter for single homeless women. This is our newest facility, created in response to the growing number of homeless women in our community. Before this facility was created, homeless women were housed in a separate area within the mens emergency shelter. It grew evident that this arrangement was problematic, and that the women could best be protected and supported in pursuing their goals given a separate facility. Now that the women have a safe place of their own, they have truly developed a supportive, community environment. The residents work together to maintain the shelter, advocate for each other, connect each other to resources, and encourage each other to make positive changes in their lives. All residents receive three meals a day, clothing, and basic hygiene items. They are also connected with supportive case management services and have access to all the services the Opportunity Center has to offer.",

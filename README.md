    the proposed project

        Our proposal is to create a website that would serve to help individuals experiencing homelessness in Texas. We accomplish this task by connecting people in need to homeless shelters, raise awareness for organizations working to assist homeless populations, and highlight local volunteer opportunities to aid homeless individuals.

    URLs of at least three data sources that you will programmatically scrape (at least one must be a RESTful API) (be very sure about this)

        https://zylalabs.com/api-marketplace/data/homeless+shelters+api/2676 : RESTful API for homeless shelters
        https://developers.google.com/maps : google maps api 
        https://caritasofaustin.org/events/list/ : has a list of upcoming volunteer events in austin (will look for more across Texas)
        https://sunrisenavigationcenter.org/volunteer : event calendar in austin 

    at least three models

    1. Homeless shelters in Texas
    2. County statistics and organizations/non-profits in that county 
    3. local volunteer events to aid homeless individuals. 
    4. (optional) different ways to help (i.e. food drive helper, clothes organizer, etc.)

    an estimate of the number of instances of each model

    1. several dozen
    2. 254 counties/instances
    3. dozens
    4. (optional) 10 or less

    each model must have many attributes

    describe five of those attributes for each model that you can filter or sort

    1. Location, region, size (# of beds), name/contact, % of max capacity reached, languages offered, alphabetical sorting. 
    2. alphabetical, size of county, # of organizations working in county, # of homeless people, # of homeless shelters.
    3. which county events are in, location/proximity, calendar date, type of volunteering, donation-based (yes/no).

    instances of each model must connect to instances of at least two other models

    instances of each model must be rich with different media (e.g., feeds, images, maps, text, videos, etc.) (be very sure about this)

    describe two types of media for instances of each model
        1. Photo of shelter, google maps location, text describing contact information. 
        2. Graphic highlighting county location within Texas, descriptions/logos for organizations/nonprofits in the county.
        3. pictures/fliers depicting the event alongside a text description.

    describe three questions that your site will answer
        1. Where are homeless shelters in Texas located?
        2. How are different counties affected by homelessness and how are individuals within the county assisting homeless populations?
        3. How can I help/volunteer in my local community?
    
 We will then approve the project or request that you refine the idea.

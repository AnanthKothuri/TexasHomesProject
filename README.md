Name of the project:

    texashomesproject

The proposed project:

    Our proposal is to create a website that serves to help individuals experiencing homelessness in Texas. We will accomplish this task by connecting people in need to homeless shelters, raise awareness for organizations working to assist homeless populations, and highlight local volunteer opportunities to aid homeless individuals.

URLs of at least three data sources that you will programmatically scrape (at least one must be a RESTful API):

    https://zylalabs.com/api-marketplace/data/homeless+shelters+api/2676 : RESTful API for homeless shelters
    https://developers.google.com/maps : google maps api
    https://caritasofaustin.org/events/list/ : has a list of upcoming volunteer events in austin (will look for more across Texas)
    https://sunrisenavigationcenter.org/volunteer : event calendar in austin

At least three models:

    1. Homeless shelters in Texas
    2. County statistics (and organizations/non-profits in that county)
    3. Local volunteer events to aid homeless individuals
    4. (optional) different ways to help (i.e. food drive helper, clothes organizer, etc.)

An estimate of the number of instances of each model:

    1. several dozen
    2. 254 counties/instances
    3. dozens
    4. (optional) 10 or less

Each model must have many attributes.

Describe five of those attributes for each model that you can filter or sort:

    1. Location, region, size (# of beds), name/contact, % of max capacity reached, languages offered, alphabetical sorting.
    2. alphabetical, size of county, # of organizations working in county, # of homeless people, # of homeless shelters.
    3. which county events are in, location/proximity, calendar date, type of volunteering, donation-based (yes/no).

Instances of each model must connect to instances of at least two other models.

Instances of each model must be rich with different media (e.g., feeds, images, maps, text, videos, etc).

Describe two types of media for instances of each model:

    1. Photo of shelter, Google Maps location, text describing contact information
    2. Graphics highlighting county location within Texas, descriptions/logos for organizations/nonprofits in the county
    3. Pictures/fliers depicting the event alongside a text description

Describe three questions that your site will answer:

    1. Where are homeless shelters in Texas located?
    2. How are different counties affected by homelessness and how are individuals within the county assisting homeless populations?
    3. How can I help/volunteer in my local community?

We will then approve the project or request that you refine the idea.
